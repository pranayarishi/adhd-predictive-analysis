# ADHD Predictive Analysis - Demo

[Link to Demo](http://52.14.121.201/)

We built a demo for the study using Flask, and hosted it on AWS. There is a slight possibility that the demo may not be live on the given link due to technical or AWS issues.

## Steps to run demo on local
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the demo folder
2. Create a python environment if needed
3. Install prerequisites ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Run the app ```python app.py```
5. By default the app will run on port `80` in `debug` mode. Feel free to change it in app.py and run the app again
